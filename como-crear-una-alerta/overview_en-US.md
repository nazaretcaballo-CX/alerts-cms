Fill in the fields below:

**Name (for internal use)**. Name of the alert you are creating. This is a field for internal use, so it is not visible in the app at any time.

**Description (for internal use)**. Description of the alert you are creating. This is a field for internal use, so it is not visible in the app at any time. 

{% hint style="success" %}
ðŸ¤“ Use this field to describe the alert and what consequences it has for the user. This can help you identify the alert when you have the complete list. It could also be useful when you need to sort the alerts and therefore decide which one is more important than another.
{% endhint %}

**Public ID**. This field is automatically populated when you fill in the **List name (for internal use)** field. You can change the default value. However, please note that this field does not support spaces, accents or other special characters.

**Target page**. Select the page on which the alert will be displayed. 

**Provider**. Select where the alert information comes from:

* **Preconfigured**. The alert information and its content is provided by API. If you choose to configure the alert through an information provider, select it in the **Preconfigured provider** drop-down menu.
* **New**. The content of the alert is configured manually through the CMS in the next step.

Click on **Continue** to proceed to the next step.
