### Duration of the alert

In this section you can configure, if necessary, the time for which the alert will be in effect.

* **No specific time** . Select this option if you do not want to set a specific validity for the alert. With this option the alert will be shown to the user if the audience that has been configured applies to him/her and if the alert is Published.
* **Specific time** . Select this option to indicate the start date and/or end date. In this case the alert will only be shown to the user for that time interval, and as long as the user belongs to the audience that has been configured for the alert and if it is Published.

### Create test preview \(optional\)

From this last step you can also create a test for the content that you have set up before it impacts a large mass of users. 

\{% hint style="success" %\}
🤓 This step is optional, although it is highly recommended that you run a test before publishing.
\{% endhint %\}

In the **User ID \(optional\)** field you can add one or more user IDs, separated only by commas \(no spaces\), on which you want to test. Click **Create test** to start the test and evaluate the content.

\{% hint style="info" %\}
**How to obtain the user ID** 

1. Make sure you have the Enterprise version of the app downloaded.
2. Open the app
3. Shake the phone
4. Access the "Authentication" section
5. the number you need is the one in the field **User ID** \{% endhint %\}
