#### What is an alert?

An alert is a message that is displayed to the user on one of the app's pages. 

Alerts can be configured so that users have to read them and do something with them \(not "closable"\). They can also be configured so that the user can decide to close them and therefore skip them or execute actions later \("closable"\).
