How to reorder alerts
=====================

The order in which the alerts are displayed is really important. The order of the alerts is configured from the initial screen. Click **Reorder alerts** to change the order of the alerts.

**Select target**. Select the target audience for which you are going to order the alerts in the drop-down menu. 

Configure the order of the alerts with a simple drag and drop. Note that the order is from top to bottom. In other words, the one at the top (the highest one) will be the alert that will be shown to the user first. 

Obviously, the user is shown the first alert that applies to him/her. In other words, you must take into account that the alerts are configured by audience and that, therefore, the user will be shown the first alert that applies to him/her.

Click **Save order** to save the new order or **Cancel** to discard it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The main alert screen displays all alerts created regardless of the target audience to which they belong. Therefore, the alert sorting process is related to a specific target audience and the order of the main screen does not have to be the actual order.
